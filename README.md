This script is intended for use on UO Eventine.

Not intended to be used for AFK mining: AFK resource collection is NOT ALLOWED on UO Eventine.


The script's interface is somewhat self-explanatory, but this README explains the details.

I bolded the parts I thought most important to explain.

* Summary:
	* Mines ore vein(s) to completion.
	* Add the script to your Scripts folder in your RE (Razor Enhanced) directory and add the script in RE under the scripting section to use.
		
	* __The script is not perfect and has some edge case imperfections; the stop button can sometimes stop it from working, necessitating restarting the script.__
	* __If it starts to misbehave I recommend closing the script via the close button at the top right or via the RE scripting menu.__
	* __I will try to fix any/all bugs. Feel free to PM me (Geronimo) if you have any problems.__

* BUTTONS:
	* Choose Tool Manually:
		* This allows the user to mine with a specific tool of their choosing. This feature is disabled by default.
		* Clicking the button and target your preferred pickaxe to use this feature.

		* The default tool mode searches through the player's backpack and selects a tool arbitrarily (excluding gargish pickaxes as explained within its respective button description).
		* The default tool mode will also try to create a shovel if the user does not have any tools in their backpack.

	* Clear Manual Tool:
		* If a user has selected a manual tool, this button clears that selection, so the script will revert to the default tool mode.

	* __Set Ore Bag__:
		* The user must choose a bag for their ore.
		* This button allows the user to choose the bag in which they wish to store their ore.

		* This button must be used every time the script is run with the exception of the BAG ALTERNATIVE described below.

	* Toggle Using Gargish Pickaxe:
		* This allows the user to decide whether or not they want to mine with (a) gargish pickaxe(s). This feature is disabled by default.

		* If this feature is enabled, only gargish pickaxes will be selected to use for mining.

		* If this feature is disabled, gargish pickaxes will not be selected for mining.

		* If a tool is chosen manually, this feature is ignored.

	* __Toggle Rail Mining__:
		* This allows the user to decide whether they want to mine along a rail. This feature is disabled by default.
		* The default mode simply mines to completion any ore veins within range of the player's current location.

		* Rail Mining is described below.


* __RAIL MINING__:
	* A rail is just an ordered set of locations.
	* Rail Mining entails attempting to mine at each of the locations in the rail in order.

	* A rail can be created using Mourn's RailRecorder.py script found [here](http://razorenhanced.net/download/scripts/mourn/RailRecorder.py).

	* __For use in this script, the user must have their rail file in a folder named "Rails" in their Data folder in their Razor Enhanced directory.__
	* __Note that the "Rails" folder does not exist by default, so it must be created manually by the user.__
	* __Alse note that the rail recorder stores the rail file in the user's Documents folder, so the rail file must be moved after creation to be used with this script.__

	* __To mine a specific rail, just make sure the corresponding file is in the Data folder and put the rail's name in the script's textbox where it says Rail_Name.__
	* A rail's name corresponds to the name chosen when creating the rail with Mourn's RailRecorder.

	* __The Pathfinding is not perfect and if the character gets stuck the mining work will stop.__
	* My recommendation is manually moving your character until they are no longer stuck.
	* This should not be a problem since AFK resource gathering is not allowed on Eventine anyway.


* __BAG ALTERNATIVE__:
	* Instead of using the Set Ore Bag button every time the script is run, the user can manually put their bag's Serial in the script's code at the top.

	* Directions:
		1. Select this script in the scripting section in RE and click Edit.

		1. Click the Inspect Entities button at the top of the Enhanced Script Editor.

		1. Select the bag you want to use for mining.

		1. In the Enhanced Item Inspector copy The Serial number of the bag (of the form 0xXXXXXXXX)

		1. Paste that number on line 6 of the script to replace the serial number currently their.

	* This will cause the script to set the ore bag to that selected bag every time it is run.
	* This means you don't need to use the Set Ore Bag button and target that bag every time.
	* Using the set ore bag button will override this manually selected bag.

* __Known Bugs__
	* Most bugs I've experienced are a result of malfunctions with rail mining.
	* To mitigate bugs with rail mining, I would recommend not pressing start until your character is somewhat near the first location in your rail.
	* If the STOP button is pressed and there is no message stating "Finished with mining work." then the script may not continue to function as intended which will necessitate stopping the script using the RE stop button or with the close button on the interface, then starting the script again.
	* __I have not experienced, nor do I expect and bugs whose effects last beyond the termination of the script in which they arose (i.e. to my knowledge, any bugs that come up only affect the script until you close it; they do not have an effect when running the script again)__.
